# IPL_Turtle_Race_Game
This is the project from my turtle learning ,I try to make it interesting by naming it to ipl big teams CSK,MI,KKR,RCB
 
Toughness level : Easy

Steps:-
step1:-First import turtle and define objects(as turtle) with for loop 
step 2 :- Now inside the for loop define different color and different position for each turtle object
          (Color you can define by list and same for the starting position of the turtle object)
step 3 :- store the different turtle object inside the list using append function
step 4 :- now you can ask user for the jersey colour of their fav. team which you can do with screen.textInupt(text = "",prompt="")
step 5 :- to make the turtle run just use the for loop and forword funtion with random input (so import random module also)
step 6 :- to decide which team win you need to check for the turtle if it reach to right most coordinate 
step 7 :- match the answer of the user to the turtle who reach first 
 
If i can do this you can do this ,Try first before you look the solution
